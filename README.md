# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This week's project was to build a Cluedo mystery picker using the random selector fucntion.

## The problem

I made a scetch on a paper to see how everything was conenected. Once I understood that it went quite easy to connect the functions and to create the function to reaveal the mystery.

Next step would be to make a refresh button and to create a shuffleFunctionWeapon.
